Integration Methods
===================

KASKO supports 2 integration methods by default.

KASKO JS
~~~~~~~~~~~

This integration method is used to load the KASKO Widget onto your site.
The KASKO widget is an end to end solution that will load onto your site
and allow the full insurance transaction to take place.

Get started with  :ref:`kasko_js` here

REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~

The REST API integration method is used for deep integrations
(i.e. within you existing booking flow).

We are always happy to hear from our users, so if you have any feedback
