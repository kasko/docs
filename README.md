Kasko Docs
==========

Based on Slate - see docs below. To get up and running run these commands:

```
bundle install
npm install
```

Only update files in the `source` folder, and then run

```./node_modules/.bin/gulp watch```

to build the files into the `build` folder.

If you just want to build once, do:

```./node_modules/.bin/gulp build```
